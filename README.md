# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit Card Fraud Detection using SOM(unsupervised) and Deep learning(supervised) is a project as term project for Neural Network class (2018) in Computer Engineering, Chulalongkorn University

## Short introduction
```
The project aims to see how well Self-Organising-Map(SOM), which is unsupervised model, can work in credit card fraud detection problem, which is supervised problem, in Self_organising_map.ipynb.
Also I have provided Deep learning model, in Classification.ipynb, to actually how well Supervised model can handle this problem, and we expected that Supervised model should give better performance.
